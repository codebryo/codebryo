# Hi there 👋

My name is Roman (he/him) and I live in beautiful Austria, in St. Pölten, close to Vienna.

I'm a Product Engineering Leader with a strong tech background, built over the course of 12+ years in high stakes startups and working with interanational companies and clients. 
Leading teams, and aligning ambitious product visions with sustainable engineering work and practices is where I excel. 

I am always happy to consult companies, speak at events and if time allows, dabble in Open Source.
