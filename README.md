# Hi there 👋

My name is Roman (he/him) and I live in beautiful Austria, in St. Pölten, close to Vienna.

I'm a Product Engineering Leader with a strong tech background, built over the course of 12+ years in high stakes startups and working with interanational companies and clients. 
Leading teams, and aligning ambitious product visions with sustainable engineering work and practices is where I excel. 

I am always happy to consult companies, speak at events and if time allows, dabble in Open Source.

## What I do professionally:

I'm currently working as Head of Product at a social media management tool. In the past I held roles like VP Engineering, where I supported Engineering Teams of 40+ People. One of my main goals has always been in connecting engineering and product. Only when you understand why you build something, you'll have great answers on how to build it.
