### How I work

As Manager I follow 3 general principals:

**Trust & Autonomy**

Trust has to go in both directions. I trust you and you trust me. And this is something I build the whole work relationship on. It's the only thing allowing to really make progress on everyhing we work on.

I am not a micro manager. When I trust you, I'll also trust you'll do the right things. I am here to support and help!

**Transparency**

I'll always be transparent and do expect the same from you. 

**Support**

I care for being approachable at all times. My goal is to support you so you can do your best work at all times. I'll support you on progressing your carrer, reaching your next goals and keeping a good work/life balance. We're in this for the long run! 🐫
